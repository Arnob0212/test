Q. EF Core vs EF Framework:
A. Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and Entity Framework 6 (EF6) are both popular ORM tools for .NET, but they have some key differences. EF Core is a modern, lightweight, and cross-platform version that works well with .NET Core and supports features like LINQ, async queries, and compiled queries. On the other hand, EF6 is older, Windows-only, and considered more mature but lacks some of the flexibility and modern capabilities of EF Core. Choosing between them depends on your projectâ€™s platform requirements and need for new features.

EF Core highlights:
1). Cross-platform support
2). Modern features like async and compiled queries

EF6 highlights:
1). Windows-only
2). Mature and stable
