Q. What is ORM?
A. ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique that connects C# classes to database tables, making it easier to manage data. It lets developers work with databases using familiar C# objects instead of writing complex SQL queries by hand. This approach improves productivity and makes applications easier to maintain over time. By abstracting away raw SQL, developers can focus more on business logic and less on database syntax.

Key features:
1). Boosts developer productivity
2). Improves code maintainability
3). Provides abstraction from SQL
