Q: Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.  
A: Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It helps simplify code by breaking down complex tasks into easier sub-tasks. For example, predicting future values over multiple years can be done by recursively applying growth rates each year. Recursion allows us to write shorter and more readable code compared to loops. However, it should be used with care to avoid unnecessary memory use or infinite loops.
