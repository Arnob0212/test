Q: Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
A: The time complexity of the given recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of years. This is because the function calls itself once per year, reducing the year by 1 in each call, until it reaches 0. So if you forecast for 5 years, the function runs 5 times.

Q: Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
A: Although the recursive method is simple and efficient for small inputs, it can be optimized further by converting it into an iterative approach. Since this problem doesnâ€™t recalculate the same inputs repeatedly, the simpler way to optimize it is to avoid recursion and use a loop instead. Iterative solutions avoid function call overhead and are better for larger values of year.for larger data we can use mathematical based algorithm.
