Q: Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.  
A: Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), which means it checks each and every element one by one until it reaches the element which is being searched or till it reaches the end. On the other hand, binary search operates with O(log n) time complexity, which works on the principle of divide and rule. It divides the array into half after each iteration, but the array has to be sorted for it to work. So, while linear search works on unsorted data, binary search is much faster on sorted arrays. In practical terms, binary search is significantly more efficient for large datasets. However, its performance advantage depends on the ability to maintain sorted data.

Q: Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.  
A: For an e-commerce platform where speed is crucial, binary search is more suitable as it provides faster search times on large sorted datasets. Since the products are kept sorted it is easy for the algorithm to check fast. However, linear search may still be used for smaller or unsorted collections. It is simpler and doesn't require pre-sorting, making it useful in limited scenarios. Overall, binary search is better for scaling and performance in real-world applications.
