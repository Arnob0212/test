Q: Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.  
A: Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), meaning it checks each element one by one until it finds the target or reaches the end. On the other hand, binary search operates with O(log n) time complexity, as it divides the dataset in half with each step, but it requires the data to be sorted. So, while linear search works on unsorted data, binary search is much faster on sorted arrays. In practical terms, binary search is significantly more efficient for large datasets. However, its performance advantage depends on the ability to maintain sorted data.

Q: Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.  
A: For an e-commerce platform where speed is crucial, binary search is more suitable as it provides faster search times on large sorted datasets. Since products often need to be searched quickly based on IDs or names, a sorted structure can greatly improve performance. However, linear search may still be used for smaller or unsorted collections. It is simpler and doesn't require pre-sorting, making it useful in limited scenarios. Overall, binary search is better for scaling and performance in real-world applications.
