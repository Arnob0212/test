Q: Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.  
A: Big O notation is a mathematical representation that describes the orst time complexity of an algorithm's runtime as the input size grows. It helps to analyze the maximum time required for a large dataset, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms. By using Big O, we can compare different algorithms to determine which is more scalable and efficient in the long run. For example, O(n) is better than O(n²) for large datasets. This notation is essential for designing performance-optimized systems.

Q: Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.  
A: In search algorithms, the best-case scenario refers to when the item is found immediately — usually the first element checked, which can take constant time (O(1)). The average-case considers a typical run, where the item might be found halfway through, depending on data distribution. The worst-case happens when the item is at the end of the list or not present at all, requiring a full scan — leading to O(n) for linear search and O(log n) for binary search. Understanding these scenarios helps in selecting the right algorithm for different contexts. It also aids in resource estimation and performance tuning.
